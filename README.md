# Portfolio

Hello, there! My name is Caio and I am an undergraduate student of economics on University of SÃ£o Paulo. My main interesting fields are data sience, machine learning, programming, and financial markets.

Here you can have access to some of my projects.

# Projects

* **Credit Card Fraud Detection:** This projects uses machine learning algorithms to classifiy transactions in credit cards as fraudulent or not. [Link](https://github.com/CaioLSouza/my_portfolio_en/blob/main/Credit_card_fraud_detection_with_machine_learning.ipynb).

* **Churn Prediction:** Churn prediction: This project uses a dataset from a telecommunications company to predict the occurrence of churn, i.e., the number of service cancellations by the company's customers. It contains an exploratory analysis of the data, in addition to the construction of two machine learning algorithms -- logistic regression and XGBoost -- to predict the occurrence of churn.
