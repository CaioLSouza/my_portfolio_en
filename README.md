# Portfolio

Hello, there! My name is Caio and I am an undergraduate student of economics on University of SÃ£o Paulo. My main interesting fields are data sience, machine learning, programming, and financial markets.

Here you can have access to some of my projects.

# Projects
* **AIRBNB Exploratory Data Analysis**: Here, I made an exploratory data analysis of the AIRBNB dataset of Los Angeles. It was possible to study the dataset, extract some insights and visualize the data.

* **Credit Card Fraud Detection:** This projects uses machine learning algorithms to classifiy transactions in credit cards as fraudulent or not. [Link](https://github.com/CaioLSouza/my_portfolio_en/blob/main/Credit_card_fraud_detection_with_machine_learning.ipynb).

* **Churn Prediction:** Churn prediction: This project uses a dataset from a telecommunications company to predict the occurrence of churn, i.e., the number of service cancellations by the company's customers. It contains an exploratory analysis of the data, in addition to the construction of two machine learning algorithms -- logistic regression and XGBoost -- to predict the occurrence of churn.

* **Insurance Premium Prediction with Auto ML:** The recent automated machine learning techniques were used in this project to predict the insurance premium for a health company. The aim was to explore how auto machine learning can optimize a data scientist's time and make him more concerned with tasks that are more focused on the specific problem he is trying to solve and that cannot be automated.
